# **Introduction**
Every year, people from all backgrounds from sports fanatics to data scientists come together to make predictions on the NBA finals and place bets on the outcomes of basketball games. In this project, we developed quantitative methods of measuring each team's historical performances and assessed the most relevant factors in determining the outcome of an NBA game.

# **Methodology**
## A. Finding A Data Source

Data on NBA teams, games, and players come in a myriad of modified formats and factors. Since the NBA is quite a popular league, many independent actors take it upon themselves to convert the raw performance of each athlete into unique metrics, visuals, and databases, creating heatmaps of shot selection or even their own statistical metrics of performance. Maintaining the integrity of this project required us to filter through the noise and assess which sources are of greatest significance. Through research on the standard amongst sports enthusiasts, we found open access to the most reliable source for recorded data (i.e. uncalculated metrics like games won, rebounds, assists, etc.): An API of game, player, and team data owned and made publicly available by the NBA. Within this API are vast repositories of information dating back to the 1996-1997 season. Here we took a bifurcated approach on determining relevant factors. On one hand we had discovered a method of determining future success based on historical wins, but moving in this direction dejected the most intuitive approach of assessing a combination of box-score metrics. So, we split our research into two approaches. Moving forward, this paper will also be split in two to properly assess the methodology of our research as a whole. 

## B. BoxScore: Sourcing Game Box Scores
When constructing our Box Score dataset, we pulled information from two endpoints: leaguegamefinder.md and teamestimatedmetrics.md. 

**leaguegamefinder.md:** Composed of 6 datasets, this endpoint gave a box score of individual game data. Using the first dataset, we created a dataframe of games from April 16th, 2024 (the most recent game played) dating back to the start of the 2019-2020 season (the earliest game in the dataset). This dataframe contained the following information:

## C. BoxScore: Data Wrangling
After sourcing these two datasets, we joined the team ratings/rankings onto the game data on the team name, effectively creating a dataframe (13795, 57) where each row of games included the teamâ€™s rating and ranking. To ensure that our data accurately accounted for all NBA teams, we checked the unique team abbreviation and found that it was the exact number of teams (30). Next, we inspected the type of data within our table and found nothing out of the ordinary. After clearing four rows that contained null values, we transformed the win-loss column from W/L to 1/0, changing the data type to integer as well. Finally, we took the box score data and aggregated the means of each team in the following categories: ['FG_PCT', 'FG3_PCT', 'FT_PCT','TOV','STL','BLK','REB','PF', 'PLUS_MINUS']. After joining these values to the table, we began building our model.


Sourcing Team Win-Loss Results
After some initial data wrangling from NBA API, we created two datasets: 'gameLogs' and 'nbaHomeWinLossModelDataset'. In these two datasets, we selected relevant columns that we thought were key to our modeling portion of the project. We created new columns that were calculated from the raw data, such as total win percentage and last game home win percentage from the original columns. The primary goal of data wrangling was to distill the raw game data throughout the seasons and aggregate the game data to find overall winning percentages of teams against each other and their performances throughout the seasons.

We eventually arrived at 'nbaHomeWinLossModelDataset' with the following fields and field descriptions.

## D. Explanation of tools and libraries utilized in the Jupyter Notebook
In our modeling training, we utilized several powerful libraries and classes essential for machine learning tasks in Python. We used Pandas, Matplotlib.pyplot, and Scikit-learn. Within Scikit-learn, we leveraged specific classes tailored for machine learning tasks. RandomForestClassifier has enabled effective classification and regression through its ensemble learning method based on decision trees. For regularization and feature selection in high-dimensional datasets, we utilized Lasso and Ridge linear regression techniques. LogisticRegression has proven valuable for binary classification tasks, offering simplicity and interpretability. Hyperparameter tuning has been optimized using GridSearchCV, enhancing model performance. Lastly, StandardScaler has been crucial for preprocessing data by standardizing features, ensuring uniform scales and improving the efficiency and convergence of many machine learning algorithms, particularly in the context of big data analysis.

## E. Detailed walkthrough of the analysis workflow
Our workflow process was split across several notebooks, but it follows the sequence of data gathering, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, model building and final conclusion. In the model building phase, we split the data into test and training with the game result as our y variable and the rest as the x variables. We split the test and training data into a 1:2 ratio split. 

## F. Explanation of statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, or other techniques applied
In the 'game_wins_modeling' notebook, we employed various ML algorithms and regression methods: Logistic Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. Among these methods, Logistic Regression was the most accurate and precise predictor and proved to be quite useful due to its effectiveness at predicting a binary variable (Win or Loss). We measured 'accuracy' as the ability to predict a game's final score in the testing data. This was calculated as a proportion of correctly predicted games to the total amount of games.


# III. Results and Analysis

## A. BoxScore: Model Training
Using a train size of 75%, we build training and testing dataframes. Our list of constant variables toggled quite a bit as we assessed relevant factors in improving the modelâ€™s accuracy. After utilizing linear probability to determine the effect of each variable, we arrived at a final list of relevant variables: ['E_OFF_RATING', 'PLUS_MINUS_y', 'E_REB_PCT', 'FTA', 'FG3_PCT_x'] (_y indicates a team data average, _x indicates an individual game statistic). 

## B. BoxScore: Visualizations and EDA
For the most part, the visualizations of these variables are unremarkable. Since our factors are already aggregated to the teams, what we see in our visualizations are just indicators of frequency which doesnâ€™t allow us to better understand which type of teams might find success. Since the win/loss data is binary, we would also be unable to glean anything from a scatter plot relating the variables to the wins/losses.

# D. Interpretation of results and their implications
Logistic Regression:
An accuracy score of 0.61 signified that 61% of our forecasts were correct relative to the total number of guesses. A precision score of 0.65 indicated that our model accurately predicted 65% of forecasts in the positive direction (i.e., when the team wins). The recall score, quantifying the model's ability to correctly identify positive class instances, stood at 0.62, representing the ratio tp/(tp + fn), where tp denotes true positives and fn represents false negatives. This metric assumes significance, particularly in scenarios where the cost of false negatives is substantial, such as predicting cancer from healthcare data.

Given the objective of predicting the winning team in games and the absence of tangible costs associated with false negatives, optimizing the model for precision rather than recall is deemed optimal. With an F1 score of 0.63, it was evident that the model could be further refined to yield improved results. Presently, indicator scores fell within the 0.60-0.65 range, prompting the pursuit of enhancements to elevate model performance to a target range of 0.70-0.80. The acceptance threshold for the minimum score was set at 0.50, considering that a completely random W/L prediction would result in a 0.50 accuracy rating for a binary variable.

Lasso Regression:
The Lasso Regression model yielded a moderate level of predictive accuracy, with an accuracy score of 0.548. This value suggests that approximately 54.7% of the model's forecasts were correct relative to the total number of predictions. The precision score, indicating the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances among all instances predicted as positive, was 0.577. This implies that the model accurately predicted around 57.7% of instances where the target variable was positive, reflecting a reasonable level of precision in identifying relevant outcomes. However, the recall score, measuring the model's ability to capture all positive instances from the dataset, stood at 0.643. This value indicates that the model identified approximately 64.3% of all actual positive instances, suggesting a relatively high level of recall.

Despite the model's moderate performance in accuracy, precision, and recall, its F1 score, which harmonizes precision and recall, was 0.608. This value suggests that the model achieved a balanced trade-off between precision and recall, indicating reasonable overall performance. However, the model's performance in terms of error metrics was less favorable, as evidenced by the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values, all hovering around 0.452. These error metrics indicate the average magnitude of errors between predicted and actual values, with lower values desired for better model performance. Furthermore, the negative R-squared (R2) value of -0.825 suggests that the Lasso Regression model performed poorly in explaining the variance in the target variable, indicating a lack of fit to the data.

Ridge Regression:
The Ridge Regression model exhibited a moderate level of predictive accuracy, with an accuracy score of 0.553. This score suggests that approximately 55.3% of the model's forecasts were correct relative to the total number of predictions, indicating a reasonable degree of predictive capability. Moreover, the precision score of 0.588 implies that the model accurately predicted around 58.8% of instances where the target variable was positive, demonstrating a satisfactory level of precision in identifying relevant outcomes. However, the recall score, measuring the model's ability to capture all positive instances from the dataset, stood at 0.608. This value indicates that the model identified approximately 60.8% of all actual positive instances, reflecting a moderate level of recall.

Despite the model's moderate performance in accuracy, precision, and recall, its F1 score, which provides a harmonic mean of precision and recall, was 0.598. This value indicates a balanced trade-off between precision and recall, suggesting overall reasonable performance. However, the model's performance in terms of error metrics was less favorable, with Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values all approximately equal to 0.447. These error metrics represent the average magnitude of errors between predicted and actual values, with lower values desired for improved model performance. Additionally, the negative R-squared (R2) value of -0.803 suggests that the Ridge Regression model struggled to explain the variance in the target variable, indicating a lack of fit to the data.

Decision Tree:
The Decision Tree model displayed a notable divergence in accuracy between training and testing datasets, with a training accuracy of 0.634 and a testing accuracy of 0.608. This discrepancy suggests a potential issue with overfitting, as the model performed better on the training data compared to unseen testing data. Despite achieving a moderate level of accuracy on the testing set, there remains room for improvement to enhance generalization performance. Consequently, further optimization or regularization techniques may be warranted to mitigate overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data, ensuring robust performance in real-world applications.

Random Forest:
The Random Forest model exhibited a moderate level of accuracy, with an overall accuracy score of 0.589. This score reflects the proportion of correct predictions made by the model across the entire dataset, suggesting a reasonable degree of predictive capability. However, while the model demonstrated a satisfactory level of accuracy, further examination of additional performance metrics such as precision, recall, and error metrics would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its predictive performance. Additionally, exploring techniques for hyperparameter tuning and model optimization could potentially enhance the Random Forest model's predictive accuracy and generalization capability, thereby improving its effectiveness in real-world applications.
C. Comparison with existing literature or benchmarks, if applicable
Similar notebooks found online had a 70% accuracy score from their Logistic Regression model. This indicates that either our data and/or our models could have had more optimization to become better predictive models.
D. Comparing the various methods
Logistic Regression emerged as the best-performing model in terms of accuracy compared to the other techniques, boasting a score of 0.61. Its superior performance can be attributed to its suitability for binary classification tasks, effective capture of nonlinear relationships between features and outcomes, and strategic emphasis on precision, aligning well with the objective of predicting winning teams in games. Logistic Regression's simplicity and interpretability facilitated better model tuning and optimization, while its ability to accurately estimate coefficients even with a substantial amount of training data further bolstered its predictive capabilities. These factors combined to make Logistic Regression the optimal choice for accurately predicting game outcomes in this scenario.


# V. Challenges Encountered
## A. Identification of technical challenges faced during the project
Converting data from NBA API stats took about 90 minutes and we decided to split our notebooks into several parts to handle the data wrangling and modeling separately. In addition, our lasso and ridge regression models were quite inaccurate and when examining the MSE and MAE, we knew that there was a lot more room for improvement. The lasso and ridge models are actually both random forest models that were then trained with features determined by the lasso and ridge regressions. In addition, the handling of large data and choosing which values to compute during data wrangling required discussion amongst ourselves to figure out what really mattered from the NBA API dataset.

## B. Reflection on lessons learned and improvements for future projects
From this project, we learned that converting data from the NBA API stats was time intensive. Inaccuracies in the lasso and ridge regression models, evident from high MSE and MAE, emphasized the need for rigorous model evaluation and refinement, suggesting the exploration of alternative regression techniques. Additionally, the project highlighted the importance of transparent model development processes and collaborative discussion in handling large datasets, informing future projects for more efficient data processing and enhanced collaboration strategies.
