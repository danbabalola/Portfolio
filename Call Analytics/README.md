In this project, I took over 15hrs of audio data and converted it into text for further analysis.<br>

Using the information gleaned from this project on the most underserved areas of our business, we built a search engine, improved our
training, and added the necessary information on our FAQs to reduce ticket volume by ~30% in the six months post rollout.
